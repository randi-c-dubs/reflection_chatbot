# Quick Tutorial

## Configuring the chatbot

The initial configuration for the chatbot is done in _chatbot/config.js_. Here, you can specify the chatbot's name, initial message, and included widgets.

## Accessing GPT

Functions for interfacing with GPT are contained in _gpt/GPTController.js_. If you are doing developing and testing and don't want to make repetitive GPT calls, in _GPTController.js_ set `static devMode = true;` This will bypass requests to the GPT endpoint.

You can see examples of its use in _ActionProvider.js_ and _MessageParser.js_.

```
	// import GPTController.js
	import GPT from "../gpt/GPTController.js"

	// write instructions to give GPT
	let prompt = "Respond to the users' question as a social robot named Jibo: How are you today?";
	// send the message to GPT
	let resp = await GPT.getGPTResponse(prompt);

	// the response comes as a string
	console.log(resp); // "Hi there! I'm doing great, thanks for asking!"
```

## Parsing user messages

Functions for handling the messages a user sends to the chatbot are found in _chatbot/MessageParser.js_. Most of the action happens in the `parse(userMsg)` function.

Add an else-if statement with conditions that capture what kind of message you are looking for. For example, if the user message contains a specific word. In the body of the else-if statement, call an actionProvider function.

```
else if (userMsg.includes("Jibo")) {
	this.actionProvider.exampleHandler(userMsg);
}
```

## Responding as the chatbot

Functions for having the chatbot respond to the user are found in _chatbot/ActionProvider.js_. Create a new function to respond to what the user says and show any applicable widgets. The utility functions `say` and `sayAndShowWidget` are wrappers for posting messages and widgets to the chatbot interface. You can update the chatbot's [context or state](https://www.chatbot.com/help/stories/what-is-context/) using the `updateBotContext` function.

```
exampleHandler = async (message) => {
	// Use prompts to give instructions to GPT
	let  prompt = `Answer this question about Jibo, an awesome social robot with the 		personality of a 10-year-old who loves penguins and the color blue: ${message}`;

	// Call GPT.getGPTResponse to get response from GPT
	let  resp = await  GPT.getGPTResponse(prompt);

	// Use "say" or "sayAndShowWidget" functions to make the robot actually do things
	this.sayAndShowWidget(resp, { widget:  "JiboWidget" });
}
```

## Creating a Widget

Widgets that appear in chatbots, like the buttons, are contained in _chatbot/components_. You can create new _.jsx_ files to hold definitions for the widgets. An example widget is provided in the source code.

After creating a new widget, you must initialize it in _chatbot/config.js_

```
/* import additional widgets like so */
import ExampleWidget from "./components/JiboWidget.jsx"
...
const config = {
	...
	widgets: [
		...,
		{
			widgetName: "ExampleWidget",
			widgetFunc: (props) => <ExampleWidget {...props} />,
		}
	],
};
```

You can call the widget by name in the _chatbot/ActionProvider.js_ function.

```
this.sayAndShowWidget(resp, { widget:  "ExampleWidget" });
```
